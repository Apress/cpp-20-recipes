The link on page 442 seems to be incorrect, it allows the reader to download the “ws2_32.*dll*”

Here is another link.  The lib file is also included if you download MS Windows developers kit for their OS from Microsoft; it varies by platform.  There is a dll2lib conversion app for free available as well.
